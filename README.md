# Picasso

Picasso is simply a software renderer in order to play around with simulating OpenGL,
doing ray-tracing, multi-threading, etc.

## Building

Remember to bring in the submodules (this should bring in imgui)

```
git submodule update

```

For now, I'm trying CMake (cannot say I'm thrilled). Remember to do an out-of-source build

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

So that CMake doesn't polute your main directory with garbage.
To clean should be an easy `rm -rf build`

#### Linux

Installing is easy (if you have a package manager). If not installing SDL2 is on you.
```
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
```

#### Windows

Windows needs a little more help finding the SDL2 libraries.
How the build system is setup now is that it will look for the `SDL2` env
variable that should have the path to the base directory of the extracted
SDL2 development libraries.

What I did is to create a `.set_env.bat` that the only thing it does is
set that environment variable.
Of course, as that path is only relevant to me, I didn't check in that file.

## YouCompleteMe

I have a very simple .ycm_extra_conf.py file installed.
The only thing it needs to work out of the box (hopefully) is that we need the
env variable `SDL2` to point to the include path of SDL2.
